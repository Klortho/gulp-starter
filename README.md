Reverse engineering gulp starter

I want to transform this into a step-by-step, so that it makes sense to me.
Each step should add one more feature, and I should understand what is gained
by doing that step.

Use sandbox


# Create project directory, and initialize a git repo

Make a repo on GitHub, then, locally:

```
mkdir gulp-starter
cd gulp-starter
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:Klortho/gulp-starter.git
```

Create a README.md file and LICENSE file.  Use WTFPL for the license.
